         Flour, butter, sugar and eggs are the four most important ingredients 
        in baking cupcakes. They are used a majority of the recipes you’ll find 
        anywhere. Below I have outlined what role they play in the whole baking process.

        <table class="ingredientsMain">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/flour.jpg" alt=""><p></p>
                    <b>Flour:</b>&nbsp;All-purpose flour is simply plain flour while self-raising flour is plain 
                    flour mixed with baking powder and salt. The baking powder in self-raising 
                    acts as a raising agent.

                <td>
                    <img src="images/eggs.jpg" alt=""><p></p>
                    <b>Eggs:</b>&nbsp;Eggs are used as a thickener, binding agent, emulsifier and they provide structure to the batter. 
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/sugar.jpg" alt=""><p></p>
                    <b>Sugar:</b>&nbsp;Sugar adds sweetness of course but it also does much more. It aids in creating softness, locking in moisture and enhancing the other flavours. 
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/butter.jpg" alt=""><p></p>
                     <b>Butter:</b>&nbsp;In baking, butter is used in many different forms. These include oil and 
                    margarine. They all serve the same purpose. They increase softness in the 
                    cupcakes, especially when mixed with sugar first. They also seal in the moisture 
                    and increase the shelf life of the baked goods.
